Command and Conquer: Yuri's Revenge patch
================================================================================

Random patches and CnCNet 5 spawner.

Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are on linux, you probably have at least the first three installed. All
should be available via your package manager. If you are on Windows, you will
first need to install MinGW, which contains windows ports of GCC, GNU Binutils,
and GNU make. Afterwords, download NASM and put it somewhere GNU Make / the
MinGW shell can find it.

Petool is a utility made by us to do the patching itself and tie some loose
ends. Please `git clone` its repo too in the same directory as this one --
i.e. both repositories are in the same folder. That will petool will be build
automatically.

### Prerequisites:
 - GCC
 - GNU Binutils
 - GNU Make
 - NASM
